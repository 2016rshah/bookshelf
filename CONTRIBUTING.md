#Contributing

Think this project is awesome? Contribute to it! Think it is really awful? Contribute to it anyways to make it less awful! Either way, please contribute! If you see anything you want to help out with open up an issue. If you think your fix is simple enough not to warrant an issue just send in a pull request. As usual, follow good coding practice: please keep code neat, make sure it works, etc.

#Getting Started 

This is a Ruby on Rails project with a Postgres database:

 - To get started with contributing, make sure you have Ruby and clone this repo
 - Download [Postgres](http://postgresapp.com/)
  - Set up your databases with Postgres. Check [this](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/postgresql/postgresql_create_database.htm) for more information
  - These are the [databases](https://github.com/2016rshah/bookshelf/blob/master/config/database.yml) the app will use
 - Run `bundle install` to get all the dependencies for the project (I think this will make sure you have Rails and all as well)
 - Run `rails server` and visit `http://localhost:3000/` to see it running locally

*Disclaimer*: I set this all up a while ago, so I might have forgotten a step. If you have trouble getting started, open up an issue and let me know.

#Project Structure

Since it is a typical rails app, everything should be exactly where you expect it to be. With that being said, most of the code you might need to edit will be in `app/views`, `app/assets`, or `app/controllers`
